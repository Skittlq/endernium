# Endernium

Endernium is an advanced material, surpassing Netherite in both strength and rarity, found exclusively within The End.

## Obtaining Endernium

**Upgrade Process:**
- Acquire an **Endernium Upgrade Smithing Template** from End City Chests.
- Mine **Endernium Ore** across the End islands. When broken, Endernium Ore drops **Endernium Dust**.
- Combine four Endernium Dust to craft an **Endernium Shard**.
- Surround a Netherite Ingot with Endernium Shards to create an **Endernium Ingot**.

## Upgradable Items

Using Endernium Ingots and the appropriate Smithing Template, you may upgrade the following Netherite equipment to Endernium:
- Sword
- Shovel
- Pickaxe
- Axe
- Hoe
- All Armor pieces
