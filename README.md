# Endernium

Endernium is an advanced material, surpassing Netherite in both strength and rarity, found exclusively within The End.

## Obtaining Endernium

**Upgrade Process:**  
- Acquire an **Endernium Upgrade Smithing Template** from End City Chests.  
- Mine **Endernium Ore** across the End islands. When broken, Endernium Ore drops **Endernium Dust**.
- Combine four Endernium Dust to craft an **Endernium Shard**.
- Surround a Netherite Ingot with Endernium Shards to create an **Endernium Ingot**.

## Upgradable Items

Using Endernium Ingots and the appropriate Smithing Template, you may upgrade the following Netherite equipment to Endernium:
- Sword
- Shovel
- Pickaxe
- Axe
- Hoe
- All Armor pieces

## Special Abilities

Each Endernium tool and the full armor set comes with a unique special ability. These enhancements offer more than simple protection or powerâ€”each brings a distinct advantage to your gameplay. Such as the armor set which grants the wearer a last minute defense against death which pushes monsters in a radius away from you.
